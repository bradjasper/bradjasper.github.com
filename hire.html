          <p>Here are some common questions I get about consulting. I'd love to learn more about your project and find out how I can help&mdash;<a href="mailto:contact@bradjasper.com">contact me</a>.</p>
<br>
<br>

<h6>What's your rate?</h6>
<p>I charge $200/hr.</p>

<br>

<h6>What can you offer?</h6>
<p>I'm a programmer that loves business and has a lot of experience taking ideas and building them into great products. I focus on results and solving problems. I always try to communicate clearly and effectively and I deliver projects on-time and on-budget.
</p>

<br>

<h6>What kinds of projects are a good fit?</h6>
<ol>
  <li>Projects that work directly with stakeholders </li>
  <li>Projects that allow me to use all of my experience with not only programming, but business, marketing and product development</li>
</ol>

<p>Work that is just sub-contracted with very little flexibility probably isn't the best fit.</p>

<br>

<h6>Do you have a team?</h6>
<p>
  I do have a team of developers, designers and people I work with.
</p>

<br>

<h6>Are you just outsourcing your work then?</h6>
<p>
    No, when I bring someone else in on a project I'll let you know and it's almost always to bring in a needed skill, increase the bus factor or get more done.
</p>

<br>


<h6>What are some other sites you've worked on?</h6>
<p>I've worked on a number of big eCommerce websites like <a href="http://www.gotickets.com">GoTickets</a>, <a href="http://www.goviva.com">Goviva</a>, <a href="http://www.inseats.com">InSeats</a> and <a href="http://www.rentacarnow.com">RentACarNow</a>.</p>

<p>More details are available on my <a href="http://bradjasper.com/resume/">more traditional resume</a>.</p>

<br>

<h6>What languages do you know?</h6>
<p>I use Python the most. I'm also familiar with PHP, Javascript and Objective-C. I'm a full stack developer, so am also very comfortable on the frontend with CSS (or any preprocessors like SASS or LESS) as well.
</p>

<br>

<h6>What frameworks do you know?</h6>
<p>I'm most comfortable with Django, Angular.js and Wordpress but have no problems getting up to speed quickly on new (or even proprietary) frameworks.</p>
  
<br>

<h6>Can you manage servers?</h6>
<p>Yes, I have lots of experience managing Linux servers and setting up distributed services on Amazon Web Services (AWS)</p>

<br>


<!--<h6>My last programmer didn't work out so well. What can you do to help?</h6>-->
<!--<p>Unfortunately I hear this too often. Bad product development experiences usually take the form of:-->
  <!--<ol>-->
    <!--<li>had tons of bugs</li>-->
    <!--<li>over-budget</li>-->
    <!--<li>past deadline</li>-->
    <!--<li>code was awful and we had to rewrite</li>-->
    <!--<li>developer was hard to work with or unresponsive</li>-->
  <!--</ol>-->
<!--</p>-->
  
  

<h6>Are you open to travel?</h6>
<p>Yes, I'm happy to come out to your offices.</p>
  
<br>

<h6>Where are you located?</h6>
<p>Raleigh, North Carolina!</p>

<h6>Interested in hiring me?</h6>
<p>I'd love to chat with you and figure out how I can help on your project. I don't charge anything for the initial consultation and I'm a friendly guy :)&mdash;get in touch at <a href="mailto:contact@bradjasper.com">contact@bradjasper.com</a></p>
