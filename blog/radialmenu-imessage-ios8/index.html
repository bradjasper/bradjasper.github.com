          <p>This year at 2014 WWDC, Apple introduce lots of new shiny toys.</p>

<p>One that caught my eye in particular was the new radial menu in iMessage. Apple mentioned it was the most used app on the device, which is why when they introduced a new custom control (a radial menu) to record short audio and video messages for their newest feature&mdash;I was intrigued.</p>

<div align="center">

    <br />&nbsp;<br />
</div>


<p>The radial menu is interesting because it's essentially the "right-click" for touch (a context menu).</p>

<p>Context menu's can be a UI smell, so you have to be careful when using them. They can hide important actions &amp; make the experience of using your app worse with poor usability.</p>

<p>In this case, I think the radial menu's are a good choice (but still need some usability work). Why?</p>

<p>In the new iMessage, recording an audio or video file accidentally could be catastrophic (like sending your boss a discussion he wasn't supposed to hear).</p>

<p>But at the same time, when you do plan on recording a message (like in the car at a stop light), it needs to be fast and efficient.</p>

<p><strong>The radial menu (with its long press + slide gesture) makes accidental actions unlikely and intentional actions easy.</strong></p>

<p>And I think that's the point of iMessage's radial menu. It's a risky action that needs to be done easily. Not usually a good combo. Radial menu's (and other controls) can help.</p>

<br />


<h2>Problems with radial menus</h2>

<p>Radial menu's aren't all good though.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>They're new, and will need to be learned by a large part of the population. Apple introducing this as a standard control will help.</p></li>
<li><p>The usability can be really poor. In iMessage the tap area is too small. This is especially bad for long-presses because the miss doesn't register for 1 or 2 secondsâ€”much longer than a regular button.</p></li>
<li><p>The menus's can have too much state. iMessage changes the menu depending on your current state (newly opened or recording).  If this happens too much, a user can get confused. Radial menu's should be simple and have very little state change to be easily understandable.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Recreating the iMessage radial menu control</h2>

<p>I'd actually <a href="https://github.com/bradjasper/bjradialmenu">been working on a generic radial menu control</a> and finished it up the Sunday before the keynote. I joked that I'd hold it to see if WWDC 2014 had anything interesting to contribute before releasing.</p>

<p>As it turned out WWDC 2014 was a huge year, and in addition to releasing the radial menu in iMessage, Apple also introduced Swift, their new programming language.</p>

<p>So I did what any rational Cocoa developer would do, I re-wrote everything in Swift and recreated the iMessage radial menu:</p>

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bradjasper/RadialMenu/master/images/imessage-radialmenu-screencast-example.gif" />
    <br />&nbsp;<br />
</div>


<p>The control is built to be flexible so you can customize almost everything, including the animations themselves (built using <a href="https://github.com/facebook/pop">POP</a>, Facebook's incredible animation library for iOS).</p>

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bradjasper/RadialMenu/master/images/default-radialmenu-screencast-example.gif" />
    <br />&nbsp;<br />
</div>


<p>There's still a lot of work to be done, but there should be enough available to start implementing radial menus into your own apps (if you need them).</p>

<p>It's become clear as touch-based apps become more complex we're going to need to find new ways to express the UI's. Radial menus, when done properly, can be a great step in that direction.</p>

<p>Check it out on GitHub. Pull-requests &amp; comments welcome.</p>
